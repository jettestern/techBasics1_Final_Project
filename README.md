Our project is a food ordering system for virtual restaurant "Green Bowls". 
The customers can create their personal bowl and choose between different beverages and desserts. 

## How the program works

To place an order, the customer simply runs the main.py program.
The system is intuitive and user-friendly, guiding the customer step by step through the process of creating their own custom bowl.

First, the customer selects a base and a protein.
Next, they can choose up to three toppings from a variety of fresh ingredients.
After that, they have the option to add a drink and a dessert to complete their meal.

Once the selection is complete, a digital receipt is displayed, summarizing the entire order, including the total price.
